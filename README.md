# Robot Referencing
The objective of this project was to visualise and command a robot using an Augmented Reality Digital Twin. The entire project is made up of two repositories, this repository contains the ROS application, and the other contains the Unity application: https://github.com/lc252/HL2-RM-ROS. This ROS application recieves Hololens2 sensor data and accurately locates the robot in the Augmented Relaity scene. This transformation, as well as robot joint transformations are streamed back to the Unity application for accurate rendering of the digital twin.

This project was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis, please see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO-2PuSj33c for a demonstration, and a paper is on its way.
